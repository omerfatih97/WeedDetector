# Detection of Weeds in Agricultural Field by Image Processing

In our project, it is aimed to instantly process the image taken from the drone’s camera and to squeeze the herbs detected as a result of these operations to the foreign grass detected by the spraying valve. Thus, the farmer will be spraying only weeds, not the whole field, and will be able to grow his products in a healthy way. First preliminary studies were tested on beet field.

The system, which will become operational in other fields in the future, is also planned to add pesticide spraying and autonomous flight modes.

At the same time, our project, which will reduce the manpower, will ensure that the fields will be sprayed in situations such as the pandemic process.
